##Project
Build an app using the Rick & Morty API to do the following:
Retrieve a list of locations (name and type), along with the residents of that location and their status.
Implement the ability to search or filter location results by location name, character name or episode name.
Display the data in a manner that allows you to view the location, its residents and see an image of the resident with a representation of their name & status.
Tapping on a resident will navigate to a screen with the residentâ€™s details. On this screen, you should be able to open a form that allows you to add persisted notes about the character.
You can use a database or local storage or something else to implement persistence. Be sure to communicate your reasoning about whatever implementation method you choose.
